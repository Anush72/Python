Making the turtle race using tkinter
Steps take to make this are
1. importing the Turtle and Screen Class from turtle library, random module
2. Assiging the variable is_race_on with False boolean
3. Making the object of Screen class
4. Setup the screen with width and height 500 and 400 respectively
5. Making the input box using textinput method of Screen class to ask user which color will win?
6. Making the list of colors and y coordinates position of turtle
7. Assiging the empty class of all_turtle to make turtle
8. Using for loop to make 6 turtle using different color
9. In for looop we make turtle using Turtle class
10. Turtle method we used are shape, color, penup, and goto
11. shape - to make shape according to desire(turtle), color(taking from list), penup(no writing in screen)
and goto(assign the turtle in fixed X coordinate postion but different y_coordinate position)
12. Storing all turtle in list
13. If statement whether or not the user write and after that we assign the True boolean to is_race_on
14. while loop after is_race_on and for loop to get all turtle and assiging the random step using randit function of random
  and forward method of turtle by randomstep.
15. If anyone turtle in race touch the X_coordinate graeter than 230 then rcae stop and give result you win or loss.
